## Let me introduce myself
Hello, I'm Rachel a newbie over in the CMBA class within W&M's MSBA program. Below is my profile pic I have chosen for GitHub where I hope to fully embody my last name, Rabbitt.

This is content I've developed for my courses:

- [Time Series Decomposition](/timeseries/index.md)

Bad place for this, but below is an example GitHub link. I personally do not post my code to GitHub. The code base I use moreso is BitBucket. This Atlassian product is just a paid version of GitHub used by companies to post their code but keep it private.
- [Sample Repo](https://github.com/githubtraining/hellogitworld)

Below are videos you may or may not be interested in. They vary in topic, however the first one is an Analytics presentation I gave for the class. The second video is a little more interesting where we have USATF's latest 1500m show down race. Feel free to comment on either videos, both have been viewed and critiqued by myself.
